# S.O.L.I.D. in PHP

- S: Single-Responsibility Principle
- O: Open-Closed Principle
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle
- I: Interface Segregation Principle
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle

# Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should only have a single responsibility.

# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
 Any higher classes should always depend upon the abstraction of the class rather than the detail.
