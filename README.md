- S: Single-Responsibility Principle
- O: Open-Closed Principle
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle
- I: Interface Segregation Principle
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle

# Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should only have a single responsibility.

# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.


# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

This rule means that we should break our interfaces into many smaller ones, so they better satisfy the exact needs of our clients.

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
 
 High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

 Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
 
 Or, simply: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
